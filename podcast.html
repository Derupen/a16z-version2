                                                <p>Welcome to our special edition of clubhouse room. Live from the HLT conference in Boston. Um, I'm joined today by my partners, uh, at age 16, Z J Rugati and bank Marcela who are sort of regulars on, on this show. And, um, today what we're going to talk about is a one flavor of go to market strategy that we are seeing more of in the wild and digital.</p>
                                                <p>We actually just posted a piece this morning on our blog, I'm announcing an upcoming series on you go to market playbooks for digital health startups. And as I think we'd all agree, distribution is one of the key drivers of either failure or success in digital health companies. Um, and it's historically been a very steep climb, a steep hill to climb with a very limited set of options and a fairly immature market, um, that had, you know, a relatively low set of, um, adoption motions for, for tech enabled solutions.</p>
                                                <p>However, uh, we are definitely seeing a revolution in how digital health companies are going to market. Um, and the piece that we published this morning, we actually outlined five new go-to-market motions that we've observed in the while I'm doing air quotes with you. Um, because many of these have actually been in practice as we'll hear today, but are starting to be recognized more and more as, um, standard ways to go to market.</p>
                                                <p>Uh, the first of which is, um, this concept of B to C to B, and, um, we are actually joined by a group of amazing digital health builders here who have actually implemented a different versions of this motion in real life.</p>
                                                <p>So why don't we start by actually going around the room and having you all introduce yourselves, say what your company does and, um, and state in your version of B2C to be who is your C and who is your B we'll start with UK.</p>

                                                <p>So, um, at Maven we are the largest virtual clinic for women and families. We, um, have a fertility, maternity, pediatric, you know, family building programs, um, that we sell to both employers and payers.</p>
                                                <p>Um, We also though have a, a C motion. We also saw the individuals. You can just download Maven from the app store at any point. Um, you know, just have a quick, um, video chat with, or message with, uh, one of our 30 different types of providers, um, uh, across 250 sub specialties in women's and family health. So our, our B to B motion, I would say, um, it, or B is, is very much the, the employer or the payer, um, you know, the, the health plan.</p>
                                                <p>Um, and then our C you know, is, is definitely the patient, but also the provider. So we work with a lot of different types of providers. Um, so anyways, having all of these stakeholders, I think makes for a, more of a complicated product roadmap to make sure that we're, we're pleasing everyone, but that is, I think healthcare in general is a very complicated industry.</p>
                                                <p>So, um, kind of mirrors that many ways it's really feel to be here. And, uh, thank you so much, Julie, for having us. Awesome.</p>

                                                <p>And today we're focusing on preventing the most common reasons that older adults end up, um, in the emergency department and hospitalized. And so we're specifically focused on fall prevention and arthritis management. Our C is anyone who cares about aging. Well, but typically that's older adults, 65 plus, and our B our Medicare advantage plans and at-risk entities who, um, really want to keep this cohort as healthy and active as possible.</p>

                                                <p>Excellent. So we have a great mix here of different seas and different bees. And, um, I think that'll play out in the form of, um, different variations on this theme of, of B2C to beat and just for additional framing on what B to C to B actually means. Um, this concept of bottoms up sales, or, uh, sometimes called product led growth is an emotion that's been popularized by many of the enterprise SAS companies.</p>
                                                <p>So things like slack, zoom, Dropbox, um, products where an individual user can basically get some utility out of a self service product without a huge enterprise integration and can be sold at a price point that is either free or low cost enough for the individual to actually pay out of pockets for that initial product.</p>
                                                <p>Um, and then once the company has a critical mass of users who are acquired via that fashion, they can then flip that into a sale to some sort of enterprise. So you heard, you know, a version of this let's say with, um, with bold, where, you know, bold might acquire seniors directly through their platform</p>
                                                <p>Once they get to a critical mass of, um, of members, uh, who, uh, actually are in, in a contract with, with a certain, a Medicare advantage plan. They can then go to that plan and say, Hey, we have X number of members who have your plan that are already on our platform. Would you like to make this a covered benefit for those members?</p>
                                                <p>As you'll hear from these founders, it was a very deliberate decision on their part to execute this, this B to C to B motion. They could have actually gone the more traditional route of B to B, to C, which would be selling to an enterprise to then earn the right to get access to these end-users through, by way of that enterprise contract.</p>

Or did you decide to compromise and go in this direction because you had tried other things, um, would love to hear some of the worst stories from the early days.</p>
                                                <p>So, Kate let's start with, with Maven and, and kind of the origin story of, of your B2C to be?</p>

                                            <div class="col-r">
                                                <p>When we launched the product in 2015 and, um, it was not a time where our main. New, what telemedicine was, um, you know, selling anything in and around women's and family health, fertility, or maternity benefits.</p>
                                                <p>That also was a new category. So we, we didn't have an obvious category to sell into. We had to educate, the, the main buyers, not only on kind of virtual care as a new care model, but we also had to educate them on the fact that, you know, in nine month pregnancy product, it was just not, uh, For all of the family, aloe the families and all of the, that the women and, um, and, and couples who are trying to conceive and start family.</p>
                                                <p>So, we thought, okay, we, we know though that there's so much need and we need to do, to also show, um, momentum to investors as we continue to raise, every, every round in those early days. So there are two reasons. One is, you know, how do we just get users on the platform to prove out our thesis, that these populations are so underserved and that virtual or virtual care model will help solve some of these gaps.</p>
                                                <p>They will like a product, they will use it. And then we had to prove out a unit, our core buyers would actually would actually buy. Um, and I think the other thing that, that is just really critical right now, Um, digital health has really kind of exploded with, with COVID is being B to C to be you, you just know that you have competitive advantage in the market.</p>
                                                <p>As you know, a lot of copycats come into the industry later that you actually have a product and product metrics, um, that that users love. For us, there's a lot of clinical ROI in our business model. Um, you know, maternity is one of the top costs and so you can't drive outcomes if you actually just don't have engagement on a product that patients love.</p>
                                                <p>So it was kind of full, like to get to harness momentum, to show investors that our model was right, in the really early days of our category, as well as just, constantly challenge our product teams and challenge ourselves to have a product that users love first and foremost, and that will serve us well over the long term.</p>

                                                <p>Kate, I think what you said around, um, the need for engagement to drive the clinical outcomes and actually thinking about engagement and clinical ROI together is, um, spot on and totally the way that we approached it as well.</p>
                                                <p>For us B to C to B also came down to access. So we knew that, you know, enterprise sales and healthcare can take a long time. And initially it was, Hey, let's not gate getting our product live and getting it to individuals who might be able to pay out of pocket. Um, so let's put this into the world quickly.</p>
                                                <p>Let's try and build, you know, learn what is engaging to individuals improve and really use that as a sandbox to get big and grow quickly. And then the second way access came in, when we think about the B2B sales opportunity. Not everyone who wants to use our product or would benefit from our product is able to pay, um, particularly because we're serving older adults and, you know, fixed income or limited income, older adults, um, it can be challenging.</p>
                                                <p>And so we also thought around the necessary, like for our business model to sell B2B is to get access and coverage to those individuals who we were really trying to help become healthier. But, while doing that initial B2C motion, our second hire at bold was a clinical researcher.</p>
                                                <p>And so we started telling that story almost in parallel with going live to the individual customer. And I think that served us well when we then started to do the B2B sales.</p>

                                                <p>But, before we do that, bill, um, could you tell your version of the story from a, from a butterfly lens</p>

                                                <p>Yeah, sure. And, and full disclosure as Julia was alluding to, I was not a founder. I joined about six months into the commercialization, but for butterfly was really all part of the disruptive product.</p>
                                                <p>So butterfly is a fraction of the cost of traditional ultrasound devices. And so when you have a device that's at that cost structure, you have to be really thoughtful about how you commercialize it. You cannot. Hundreds of salespeople like the incumbents did or still do. And so it was about speed to market and access as others have alluded to the simplicity of it.</p>
                                                <p>I mean, if we had to go contract with, with large health systems early on with our use of the cloud and AI, we would have died on the vine. It just wasn't, in the cards. And then it was also with this, this lens and the inspiration of the consumerization of the enterprise. If we could get this in the hands of individuals, it would eventually find its way into the large, you know, kind of traditional, um, health systems out there.</p>
                                                <p>It's kind of the only model that we could, that we could take back then to, uh, to support the business. And so, um, in some ways it was constraint, driving innovation,</p>

Um, you know, from day one, not only were you thinking about going direct to users, but also developing that clinical narrative that you wanted to eventually take to the payers.</p>
                                                <p>Um, can you just talk through that and any other examples of how, how did your enterprise customers respond to the initial consumer acquisition engagement data that you generated in those early days? And then, you know, how did you then specifically use that in your, in your sales motion and your pitch to the enterprises?</p>

                                                <p>Cool. Um, so I'm, I am going to shut out Hari, my co-founder and partner in helping us think about working backwards and the importance of clinical ROI. Because, um, while, while we launched direct to consumer, we also found our clinical advisor at Stanford, brought on a clinical researcher and said, you know, we should be taking what we think is.</p>
                                                <p>Version of our product that we can do validation on because it will take months to do this validation anyways. And we can't, if we do these things in sequence, it will take too long and you know, you might run out of runway and like, we don't really have time for that. So, um, I think that while initially I would say even some investors were like, oh, like, this feels like you're doing a lot all at once.</p>
                                                <p>I think it was necessary when you can bring those two threads together, it did unlock, um, our enterprise cells and the enterprise conversation. I think there's two things. If you, if you lead with just the research, people will always ask what's the cohort size, you know, and if your cohort size is 20 or 50 or a hundred, they're like, that's nice.</p>
                                                <p>But like, how are you going to reach thousands of people? And so if you can actually have a story, that's two parts. It's we both know how to go out and get thousands or tens of thousands of members without any help from you. Like we control our own destiny in that way. And we know that what we're delivering can prove results because we've thought about doing this in a really rigorous way.</p>
                                                <p>And I think that that's, um, kind of what we bring together when we're pitching our enterprise customers.</p>

                                                <p>Amazing. So it sounds like clinical was kind of the main center of gravity for how you thought about, um, had the evidence generation to make the case to the enterprise.</p>
                                                <p>You mentioned cost savings as a big cost impact as a big part of, of your solution. Is that, is that mainly what you indexed on or</p>

                                                <p>Yeah, I think it's, um, it was both cost savings around maternity, which kind of comes in the form of reducing C-section rates, reducing NICU spend reducing ed visits.</p>
                                                <p>But then on the clinical side, there's also things like increased rates of breastfeeding, um, increased rates of mental health utilization, particularly for people who have perinatal mental health issues, um, and to, you know, in increased or, or measuring some of our fertility clinic partners, um, decreased rates of multiples.</p>
                                                <p>So, um, all of that was, was, was really important, um, as we were kind of honing this model, but I think the other component, um, in the early days, uh, we know that there is a direct line to clinical ROI and financial ROI. The more someone actually engages with the people on our platform, the care advocates or the tele-health.</p>
                                                <p>And so we actually had, um, a challenge where we didn't have, like in the early days of enterprise, you know, your early customers are, are not like the fortune 50 employers or the big health plans. So the smaller employers. And so we just needed, um, a volume of consumers to actually be constantly seeing our providers, um, and constantly using our product.</p>
                                                <p>And so we were able over time, one of the big things that we measure internally is the shift from how many of our members using Maven come from our B2B clients, their members, you know, they work at the companies or they're members of the payer health plans that we work with versus, um, how many are our consumers are just downloading the app.</p>
                                                <p>And so over time, you know, now the vast majority comes from our B to B to C uh, channels, but in the early days, it was very much still the vast majority of our usage, particularly on the virtual side, virtual telemedicine came from, um, our consumers and it shifted about, uh,</p>

                                                <p>Yeah, so it was multifold. One of them was just the awareness driven.</p>
                                                <p>You know, having clinicians using this and happy with it. And I think as most people probably know on this call, half of all physicians in the U S are employed by these hospital systems. And so inevitably it's going to find their way in. But the other interesting thing that happened there was an organization, kind of a safety and quality organization that had published their top 10 risks.</p>
                                                <p>I guess it was for 2020, maybe it was 2019. It was a couple years back. One of them was kind of the ungoverned proliferation of point of care ultrasound. What is, what, which is what our device is. And so we actually were building the integration and the governance elements to our software. And so we both created and exacerbated the problem, but then also brought in software and enterprise solutions to fix it.</p>
                                                <p>You had, you know, the, it organizations and potentially radiology departments, et cetera, looking to get control over ultrasound. And so we both again caused it, but then had the solution. Um, and so that was how it evolved for us.</p>

                                                <p>And then, you know, perhaps over time, maybe more of your users were coming. From the B side, but, um, you know, one of the criticisms that we sometimes hear about B2C to be is that, you know, if all digital health companies are doing this, will it just drive up customer acquisition, cost or CAC, um, because of heightened competition for these end-users, what is your take on that?</p>

                                            </div>
                                            <div class="col-r">
                                                <p>Sure. Yeah, Um, first of all, in the early days, um, definitely, I mean, whether there was just like no one, um, advertising cameras, so, we had a, a message that was resonant. That was unique.</p>
                                                <p>I think though thinking about it, like, this is just a product philosophy. I mean, it's product like growth, right? And so, what's underpinning, this is you have to have a beloved product and the, and your patients and consumers, they have to love it because that's the only way to unlock value across all of your other ecosystem partners.</p>
                                                <p>So. You know, Th the story would have been different, but we still would have watched this way, because you're showing, like you're putting your money where your mouth is. You're saying we are ultimately for the patient or for the member or for the woman with, for the family.</p>
                                                <p>And so, um, when we look at our space as well, um, you know, competitors would just launch, um, you know, two employers first without really kind of cutting their teeth with the, with the actual consumers.</p>
                                                <p>And we know their engagement levels because we're replacing them at some employers and payers and it's just, they just don't have any engagement</p>
                                                <p>yeah, I think there's some similarities to Kate. Um, for us, I think the timing was interestingly linked to the pandemic and also highlighted maybe some ages thoughts that were held by folks.</p>
                                                <p>Um, you know, 10 years ago, I would say that the digital divide for older adults was probably higher than it is now. Like we know that this divide is closing. It is still higher amongst older adults than not. And so we had a lot of conversations around like head scratching and disbelief that we could do acquisition digitally, but that is how we scale.</p>
                                                <p>And I think that's like the bet that a lot of our partners are making is that like, they want something that can scale and reach, uh, rural populations that have internet, but don't have, clinics or wellness centers nearby that they could direct their members to. They want, um, to know that, uh, less mobile, older adult with multiple chronic conditions can access something.</p>
                                                <p>And I think. We, we always believe in like product growth, like you said, Kate, but I really just think human centered design. And so in some cases, and I heard this a lot at HLT H in the last couple of days, but like this emphasis on really meeting an individual, a member of patient with what matters most to them.</p>
                                                <p>And so I think the way that we prove that, and we would always want to is first doing that B2C and then taking the story and saying, here's the impact that we're having. Here's the value that we're delivering. Don't you want them to know that you would cover this and you would have their back. And I think.</p>
                                                <p>For us in particular, just the timing of our launch two months before the pandemic began. Um, it was something that was really top of mind because traditionally there's been very low engagement in these fitness, and that doesn't mean that, um, fitness and exercise programs, aren't something that people are seeking and that they hadn't been configured or delivered in a way that actually met those individuals where they were.</p>
                                                <p>And so I think the fresh approach, and honestly, it was kind of bold to start all digital first, but, um, I think that's definitely proven that we can grow a lot faster rate than if we hadn't.</p>

                                                <p>Did you, I mean, I'm curious, it sounds like a lot of the initial engagement from clinicians was actually quite viral.</p>
                                                <p>And I'm curious, did you end up spending a lot of money on the initial acquisition? How has that changed over time? Um, you guys are obviously a publicly traded company, so I'm sure some of this data's out there, but, you know, have you found it, um, to, to become more expensive over time to acquire the same set of users as, as the market has.</p>

                                            <div class="col-r">
                                                <p>So I guess a couple of points to what the others have said. I think product led growth is we're making it sound easy. It's really hard to do that. And so few companies do, uh, you know, when butterfly commercialized, we had probably 200 engineers and two salespeople, which is completely backwards of how most companies would do it and it, and it worked out.</p>
                                                <p>Um, so getting that right and really creating value for the end user, like that is not. And so to the question about acquisition costs, I don't think it will ever be a problem for the companies that really do it well, even it gets, if it gets more crowded because at the end of the day, the thing that matters is the lifetime value.</p>
                                                <p>So if you're, if you're retaining those customers and then there's some sort of viral play, whether it's into the enterprise or whatever it may be in your case, you can make the CAC make sense. For us, what's interesting cause we're we're med device. So there's a touch and feel element to what we do. It's not software which can be experienced on your own. We, we leveraged, uh, conferences and trade shows quite a bit. And even before we had FDA clearance, we were generating a lot of hype and interest around what we were doing and capturing reservations for when the device would eventually come about.</p>
                                                <p>And so today, people aren't going to conferences the same way they used to be. So we'd have to do it differently. And if that's an important part of the strategy, which it is for us, you have to think about roadshows and doing this on your own versus the traditional conferences.</p>
                                                <p>So we have had to adapt, cost structures. I don't think it's changed dramatically through time. When you start to get into the enterprise, the numbers become much larger. So your per unit costs don't really change too much,</p>

                                                <p>to an enterprise you're ultimately trying to do one of three things. You're either trying to, um, drive some increase in value to them in the form of increased clinical benefit or increase revenue. Number two, you're trying to reduce wasteful, spend cut costs, or you're trying to number three, minimize risk.</p>
                                                <p>Can you just expand on that, on that point? And then I'd love to bring in Kate and Amanda to talk about, um, how they thought about their value proposition in that framework.</p>

                                            <div class="col-r">
                                                <p>So, you know, enterprises are complex beast in terms of how they buy, but as Jay said, I mean, your value prop has to fall into one, two or three of those things and ideally, all right.</p>
                                                <p>And you can have a story around all of them. We talked about clinical ROI. It's critical. Uh, I believe deeply is it's really about storytelling first and foremost, people organizations, even though they're enterprises, they're people within them and people buy with their hearts and rationalize with their brain.</p>
                                                <p>And so you need, you need the ROI, but it really it's about stories. And each of those three elements, um, and again, if you can do all three, that's the, that's the sweet spot, but even if you greatly improve clinical outcomes and you can just explain to an enterprise that they can break, even perhaps drive 10% ROI, that's oftentimes enough.</p>
                                                <p>I think a lot of early founders, commercial folks, and I've made this mistake think that you need to have 300% ROI, or the reality is you actually discredit your product. If you're selling it at a 300%, ROI is my experience. And so, and these organizations do not make 300% investments.</p>

                                                <p>Is there a different way you thought about it, at Maven?</p>

                                                <p>Sure. So I think it goes back to what Amanda said earlier, which is it about cohort size when you're working with the big, um, buyers of our services. And so, for us, of course, to run, um, in RCT and whatnot, you need to have an enormous sample size and you have gone through the Maven programs and whatnot.</p>
                                                <p>That takes a long time. Um, so what we were able to do, The scenario is That we were able to just show incremental improvement through large cohorts on how they're using the product, how things look in the first trimester, how things like in the second trimester, what IVF, um, you know, in a six month basis looks like.</p>
                                                <p>And so it just, it really helped us, um, tell our story as to the why of our care models. So that by the time we were ready and had enough data from our enterprise members to actually do claims-based studies to prove out our clinical and financial ROI, we were, we were ready to do that. But like, you know, we just did, we didn't have that in the early days because it took some time to build.</p>
                                                <p>And so a lot of that consumer data we had for the app, we were able to, um, talk about engagement and extrapolate using, using some of that data.</p>

                                            <div class="col-r">
                                                <p>Yeah. Um, I really like what bill said around just the, the part of the story. And I'll just share one thing that we found and had to really hone and craft our story was around costs because just looking at the data in most cases, it's very apparent that falls and fall related injuries are a top five cost for Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
                                                <p>We spend as much on falls as we do on cancer care. And what I realized was most plans are overpaying for falls and they don't even realize it. And so how could we actually tell them. Story in a way that helps them improve and sort of better understand their data or their members. And I think that two way of both, um, sort of very, very measured showing, showing the data, showing the numbers, but helping them rethink about how they're slicing that data.</p>
                                                <p>So your individuals with CIPD with diabetes, with hypertension, they are all at elevated fall risk and they're all falling. But if you're not breaking out this fall cost, you're just going to see that as adding to the costs for individuals, with those other chronic conditions. And so for us, there's, there was definitely an initial discussion and, you know, it varies person to person, organization, to organization.</p>
                                                <p>But if you couldn't find, if they didn't know those fall numbers already, like the first place to start is just aligning around the, like, what is the cost, right? Because before we start telling you how awesome our product is and how much people love it, I think like really, um, focusing on the dollars and the value that we could deliver and then.</p>
                                                <p>I also think what bill said around the ROI. I think that's actually the hot take here is that, you know, a paying for yourself is a good, good place to be. But, um, I, I think to just sort of tie what Kate said, what bill sit together, if you know your product works and you have the data to back it up, you actually have way more leverage in these negotiations to say, like, we know we can pay for ourselves, right?</p>
                                                <p>Like we've seen it and you're not kind of, it's not a bluff, that's a, we've seen it. We know. Um, and then you can all the pricing and the details that might come through contracting can really adjust to reflect that. But I do think it gives you power in those discussions to have all the pieces that we've talked about earlier.</p>

Um, I think the other thing that we're hearing here is telling the customer, that you know more about their users and their employees than they do.</p>
                                              <p>Uh, it's also, you know, a super powerful part of how this, this message messaging strategy can work. Um, So one thing that, that kid, I think you mentioned early on was how you were B to C to B strategy, intersected with your, your fundraising strategy. I'm curious, you know, what were your first round of investor conversations like? That it help or not help, um, your fundraising process to have this approach, which at the time, uh, I imagine was relatively novel in the grand scheme of things.</p>
                                              <p>And, um, and then did your choice of the B2C to be motion influence the actual set of investors that you targeted. Um, and then how did that maybe change with each stage?</p>

                                              <p>Sure. And you know, I was talking to one of my friends in digital health, who at TJ Parker, from PillPack, who, um, ended up selling PillPack to Amazon, one of the early great success stories in digital health.</p>
                                              <p>And, and one of the things we talked about a lot is that So few investors understood digital health at the time. Um, so not only were we walking into meetings and we're like, Hey, This is our product.</p>
                                              <p>Um, this is how the women's health industry works. This is how telemedicine works. It was just like too much education. And in his, in his categories, the PBMs is how the pharma pharmaceutical industry works. This is how, you know, mail order prescriptions and whatnot, which is what they were doing.</p>
                                              <p>There was a lot of kind of regulatory build-out, which meant that our growth in the early days was never going to be as explosive as a clubhouse type growth.
                                              But you had to show some momentum and so think. In our early days, we actually didn't really raise from healthcare investors. And it was just about, you know, could we hit 20% growth month over month, on our virtual visits.</p>
                                              <p>So we're, we're basically, we were proving out the telemedicine story and the fact that people would use telemedicine again, it was still really new user behavior. Um, and so we, we use that to say in our early pitch decks, Hey, look, this is a new behavior trend. We're early, we're the first verticalized telemedicine network and women's and family health.</p>
                                              <p>This is the core customer of healthcare. You know, the, the larger opportunity here is B2B. And we are, you know, we had our, our, you know, our family benefits and missionary backup product on our flags back in 2014 and 2015. So it was always kind of there, but no one ever really asked questions about it.</p>
                                              <p>Everyone just has questions about. The value prop, the customer, and then they needed to see that momentum. And so that was kind of what we found, and it was not until our series a where we eventually found, um, you know, our, our investor Lauren Brogan, who let her a, she was pregnant with her third child and, um, and understood our value prop and saw that we had some really early, but very small consumer momentum, but then really invested on the promise of the category, the pipeline that we had generated from the, you know, from employers and, and, you know, 2016 and 2017.</p>
                                              <p>And so that was really what helped us crack that. But, you know, until 2017, until we had that pipeline, it was really all about that early consumer.</p>

Well, um, yes, we know how it ended and could not have been more for tutus to, to meet when we did Julie, but, um, I'm also just loving taking notes from, from Kate's experience, having gone through more rounds of fundraising and also doing at a time when, I imagine you, Kate probably had way more of these conversations.</p>
                                              <p>I, I would say had, I can't even count how many conversations around explaining Medicare advantage and value based care because there's. Because the consumer opportunity around engaging adults over 65 also feels huge. And it's like a very separate thing. There was, there was always like a back and forth if, either explaining why there was a, a enterprise opportunity and a lot of people nudging and pushing to say, no, no, no, just like just focused on the consumer.</p>
                                              <p>I was like, well, I think there's like a real benefit to taking this sort of next level approach and saying, we want to do the validation wa we want to align both for our business growth and also to again, create access to the members. But. I honestly felt like there was fatigue. It would be like two meetings just going into the,, why this was our vision, what, what Medicare advantage was, and then coming back to wait.</p>
                                              <p>Okay. So what do you do again? Um, I think you just learn it helps you have that baseline to know when you meet the right person who has the appropriate context and expertise, and actually can be a partner. You can move a lot faster. And that's where we ended up.</p>

I know you mentioned you're not, you weren't one of the founders, but since butterfly has been a great success story, um, and it was now a publicly traded entity, to, what degree would you say kind of these early stories of the go to market, um, became, you know, at all a core pillar of, of the way that the market valued you guys or viewed you guys as different and unique, um, or if it, you know, at the end of the day, once you were at scale, it didn't really matter.</p>

                                              <p>We certainly certainly raised money before commercializing. Right. And so I mentioned driving demand and reservations well in advance of, um, of that process. And so again, I wasn't part of it, but I am certain that the tens of thousands of clinicians who raised their hand and said they wanted this device before it was available, helps drive confidence, um, in the process.</p>
                                              <p>In terms of the evolution, you know, at the, at the point where we were going public, we were just really starting that enterprise of market shift. , but there was data points around the increased lifetime value of the enterprise customer, right?</p>
                                              <p>Higher SAS revenue, of course, lower churn to be expected there. That was a valuable, element to the next act. So to speak of where the business was headed, right. As it was transforming from more of a consumer direct to physician business, to an enterprise business and how those two feed together.</p>
                                              <p>So It was really, the enterprise story was attractive and different. Cause most med device companies do not have a large software business. Um, there tends to not be good at it. So I think it was a differentiator from that standpoint and still is,</p>

                                             <p>It's a great question. I think that's actually a really hard, um, thing is, is, you know, some people you hire from consumer brands and some people you hire from 10 of traditional B2B healthcare. And so we've had to do a certain amount of work. I mean, now we're, we're much bigger and we have a amazing, um, comms team who has brought this all together.</p>
                                             <p>But in the early days, you know, when you're a dozens of people, you know, you're just constantly having to educate both sides of the company, as to like why or a B to B to C company, what that means, how healthcare works, why, human centered design is a matter, talked about, is critical for how we build product.</p>
                                             <p>And so we have to work really, really hard, um, to, you know, on our internal comms to constantly be bringing everything together and are under like, we are a digital health company and this is what we do. We have to build great technology for our consumers and we have to, you know, drive outcomes within the healthcare industry, through our payer partners.</p>

                                                <p>I'll chime in quickly. It is. It's a great point because the reality is enterprise is at least that that next step into enterprise is a different, it's a different game. And I heard this quote somewhere and I can't remember where, but basically enterprise is, it's not a team sport, it's a company sport. It takes everyone in the company coming together.</p>
                                                <p>And so thinking about pulling product managers to put together roadmaps for key clients and sharing that with them, I mean, that's just different than when you're a consumer company and kind of growth hacking, so to speak. So it does, it is quite different. It needs to be managed. You obviously, as you build an enterprise sales team and people that wear blazers and maybe even ties or used to, but when we, when we went in person that's different.</p>
                                                <p>I just think you need to be cognizant of it.</p>

                                                <p>Yeah. Yeah. I'll keep it short. I think that, um, at the leadership level, like really giving context for why something matters because you it's very easy to, to just focus on the product or maybe just focus on customer success or sales.</p>
                                                <p>And so making sure that there is like a, a clear explanation in through line, like mapping out that system for everyone to understand B to C to B or B2B to C. But, um, the relationship between those functions is super important for us. I think it's been around hiring leaders who honestly are it's okay if they're specialized, but I think building a culture of learning and learning internally.</p>
                                                <p>So it's not always, maybe the founders trying to explain it, but finding somebody who has. Uh, tenured tenured background in health care, but loves to consumer stuff and like wants to share their expertise in healthcare, but then really learn about how do you build a consumer product, the discipline that the kid's describing and vice versa.</p>
                                                <p>Um, and so I think that's been, um, something that we've really tried to emphasize at bold is just ensuring that everybody has the opportunity to learn around what this new function is. And I think it's pretty hard to find someone who has gone through or has multiple years of experience at a B to C to beak, you know, focused company.</p>
                                                <p>And so, um, I also think that like finding experts who have been through it and really learning from them or bringing them in to share that perspective, um, has been.</p>

                                               <p>Everybody. Thanks for having me up. My name's Walid. Um, appreciate having this conversation and, uh, it's something we've been leading into quite a bit over the last few months. I'm a co-founder of a, a company that's developing a health concierge for older adults. And, um, uh, was curious, you know, kind of double clicking on this concept of culture and hiring, because I feel as though the, the, the premise is so much that you're, you're either a Adidas company or a B2B company. And as you go about hiring folks, is it easier to find somebody who has a DTC background who can be trained on, uh, and learn the enterprise sales side? Or do you start with the enterprise sales side in mind and kind of build back from there? Have you, have you found that there's, uh, one avenue that works better than another, uh, on, on building this.</p>

                                        <div class="conversation-row">
                                            <div class="col-l">
                                                <strong class="name text-green-dark">Kate Lastname <span class="duration">[45:32]</span></strong>
                                            </div>
                                            <div class="col-r">
                                             <p>The short answer is it doesn't matter. It's really about the learning curve that someone's willing to go on because I think somebody who's been operating their whole life in DTC or somebody who's been offering their whole life and B2B, you know, as long as they're coming from successful cultures, and that they have an openness to learning.</p>
                                             <p>And that's kind of part of the mindset that they're bringing. There'll be, there'll be great, hopefully, um, for you. So I think that's one of the things that, um, we we've had to learn the hard way over the years is if somebody is, comes from, for instance, a consumer brand and they just refuse to learn about healthcare and they just don't care on any, you know, they put their head down and they just want to design consumer products.</p>
                                             <p>They're not going to be the right designer because you have to understand how, how the product works in the industry. Um, to, I think, design great products. And similarly we've hired some people from healthcare who. Kind of are like, well, this is the way the system works and this is how we have to do it.</p>
                                             <p>Um, then that also doesn't work because digital health is incredibly dynamic right now. And it's changing, you know, every three to six months, you know, markets are being reinvented, new, new studies are coming out. And so you just, you need those lifelong learners and you need people with such a growth mindset.</p>
                                             <p>It just, it doesn't matter where they come from. But I think a good indicator is, you know, the culture of the B2B or DTC business that they've come from,</p>

                                                <p>Yeah, just real quick hiring your first salespeople is incredibly hard, right? In a lot of times, the people that have been in enterprise and have great enterprise track records are probably not the right fit. I think, as Kate said, identifying that growth mindset and people that have been thrown in to sell early products when people weren't building decks for them and stories for them and, you know, having everything ready because it's generally what enterprise salespeople are used to.</p>
                                                <p>Right. And so thinking you really have to double click into that person's background and how hard did they have to fight for those sales? Because the first ones are really, really hard.</p>

                                                <p>Hi all, QC language currently leading payer customer delivery for all. If my question is to go, I guess, one layer deeper on the question of B2B to C, um, which is the distinction between direct to employer, we're going through payers or brokers. And so I'm wondering if you could each talk about which strategies you found to be successful for the different audiences and whether you think that's changing, given the number of digital health companies that are trying to get in front of them.</p>

                                            </div>
                                            <div class="col-r">
                                                <p>Sure I can jump in. And this is, again, I think maybe specific to our industry, every industry is a little bit different, but in women's and family health, our payer business, there's a lot of different parts of it. you know, we, on the one hand we resell, um, to, and we upsell to ASL customers through our payer partners.</p>
                                                <p>We also work with fully insured populations. And we also now. With Medicaid. And so I think as a result of that, the go to market and the payer for us, requires a much more sophisticated and, um, sell where you need to understand how the entire pair works. And it's not just, I know some other digital health platforms have just seen payers is just purely a channel into ASO.</p>
                                                <p>Um, that's, that's not how, how we're finding it. So, um, and then our employer, uh, business, um, you know, it is a frenzied market right now. I mean, every employer is saying that they're getting pitched by like hundreds and hundreds of digital health vendors. Um, and so I think that the consultants and the brokers are really, really important in that sale, because, because of the, just the volume of vendors launching, um, and you know, the lookalike marketing is insane. I mean, we see it in our category. It's like sometimes we say something and then six months later, everybody saying, um, that it's, you know, you kind of need the brokers and consultants to help that, that help the.</p>
                                                <p>The, the employers understand. What's what, so the, what we, what we find in terms of the type of person, the type of culture, the type of leadership we need in that market is just incredibly different. Um, from, um, from the payer market, I don't even think you necessarily need people who come in with healthcare benefits, backgrounds in that market because the sales are fast.</p>
                                                <p>And, um, and as long as you are, you know, working with the brokers and consultants and you have a lot of great data and you're able to tell a story, well, then, uh, you know, you're going to do well. Whereas the payers, you know, I can be really, we really do need people who come from the payer world to talk about those products and work with our, with our payer partners.</p>
                                                <p>And so that's kind of how we look at it, that wasn't the case, three years ago, but it certainly has become the case, um, in the last year,</p>

The one thing that I heard the panel say a lot is that going to the consumer first can help you refine your product, keep the engagement up and develop the evidence that you need to be able to sell your enterprise customers.</p>
                                                <p>But I love to hear through how you guys think through enrollment marketing. So working through your enterprise partners, to be able to get consumers onboarded onto your platform, which I think Chris's article last week, really highlighted the difficulties of payers, not having email addresses, limiting the amount of communication you can do.</p>
                                                <p>And so how do you think through, um,</p>

                                                <p>You know, we do a lot of campaigns, because we are driving enrollments through our, employer and payer customers. We still actually look at the importance of brand and brand marketing, as really critical. So it's less about the kind of, you know, direct advertising spend to drive, bookings on our consumer telemedicine product in the app store.</p>
                                                <p>And it's more about how do we drive brand awareness because when we drive brand awareness, we're actually reaching all of our stakeholders. And so how do you, how do you leverage campaigns to talk to all of your different audiences?</p>
                                                <p>And then once you identify the right campaign that that's able to do that, then that's where you can really put a lot of dollars behind it. And you're measuring things more on the awareness side. And then of course, that can translate to direct enrollments or, or whatnot. Versus just the Facebook ads and Instagram ads.</p>

                                                <p>Joe. I feel like if any of us had a good solution to this, that would be the ultimate secret. Um, so I definitely find that, honestly, even before you are going live during the contracting process is probably a good time to have a discussion around what our commitments around marketing. What are, you know, are you going to have access to a list?</p>
                                                <p>Is it, is it required to do an integration, direct referrals? Like for us, we've explored, um, a couple different ways and we're very much still learning.</p>
                                                <p>And I think like there's a lot of room to, you know, have more innovation in the smarter marketing and attribution, because I think even with data, there's the levels of data privacy. There's the levels of like, you know, people, um, changes to. Um, iOS and like Facebook and like these things are always shifting.</p>
                                                <p>So actually like either being able to build that expertise in house or find the right, you know, solutions that can help you be more effective is, is definitely a topic.</p>
