                                <h1>The a16z Marketplace 100: </h1>
                                <h4>Optional subtitle goes here</h4>
                                <h6>D'Arcy Coolican and Connie Chan</h6>
                            </div>
                            <p>Last February, we introduced the a16z Marketplace 100, a ranking of the largest consumer-facing marketplace startups and private companies. The series was a hit, spurring debate about the evolution of marketplaces and promising new consumer categories.</p>
                            <p>The past year has been a gut-punch for many marketplace categories. Ticketing marketplaces found their businesses drastically diminished when events were cancelled around the world. As schools were shuttered and many businesses enacted work-from-home policies, childcare marketplaces scrambled to adopt new safety precautions and stay afloat. Even the #1 marketplace <a href="#">last year</a>, Airbnb, grappled with shutdowns, cancellations, and refunds.</p>
                            <p>As 2020 drew to a close, however, many marketplaces proved to be extraordinarily resilient—a testament to the flexibility of the model. In a year when in-person interactions were heavily restricted and unemployment went through the roof, marketplaces allowed people to access the products and services they needed and, in many cases, monetize their own talents, services, and resources. From food and alcohol delivery to games, online education to outdoor getaways, marketplaces like <a href="#">Instacart</a>, <a href="#">Valve</a>, <a href="#">Outschool</a>, and <a href="#">Hipcamp</a> helped us weather a difficult year.</p>
                            <p>But while it’s tempting to view the data exclusively through the lens of COVID, as a firm we’re obsessively focused on the future: What’s new and intriguing? Which categories are growing fastest? What’s next? This year’s ranking features more than two dozen newcomers–including marketplaces devoted to thrifting, dogs, and cannabis—that not only survived the pandemic, but thrived.</p>
                            <p>The Marketplace 100 is based on data from <a href="#">Bloomberg Second Measure</a>, a consumer data analytics company that analyzes billions of purchases to track real-time consumer behavior and relative sales across over 5,200 merchants. The startups and private companies on the Marketplace 100 are then ranked using a common industry metric, <a href="#">Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)</a>, which is extrapolated from the total dollars consumers are spending against each company. <a href="#">See the complete methodology</a>, as well as data caveats and exclusions, below.</p>
                            <h4>The Top Consumer Marketplaces</h4>
                            <p>The second edition of the Marketplace 100 offers a new perspective. The ranking is revealing not only in uncovering the top companies and categories of an unprecedented year, but also in showcasing certain startups’ consistency since 2019. You’ll see that data indicated by the rank change from last year.</p>

                            <h5>Methodology</h5>
                            <div class="marketplace-info">
                                <strong class="title">Marketplace:</strong>
                                <p>A marketplace is any platform that connects buyers and sellers of goods/services with each other and facilitates a transaction.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Here are the highlights from the second edition of the Marketplace 100, which we’ll unpack in detail below: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Marketplace GMV is highly concentrated.</strong> In <a href="#">last year’s ranking</a>, four startups accounted for 76 percent of consumer spend. This year, however, more than 70 percent of the Marketplace 100’s total GMV can be attributed to just one company.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Edtech accelerates. </strong>The biggest leap from last year’s ranking was in online education. One edtech company, <a href="#">Outschool</a>, jumped 59 spots in a single year.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>It’s a battle to break out.</strong> Beyond the top three marketplaces in the Marketplace 100, the competition is tight: the difference in GMV among adjacent companies #4-100 is less than a half a percentage point. There’s likely to be movement in the ranks as startups vie for consumers’ dollars this year.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>The COVID effect is clear.</strong> Some newcomers to the list were surprising—including startups centered around fashion and travel—but indicate emerging trends in the way we shop and escape.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Categories to watch: pets, cannabis, and collectibles.</strong> Changing consumer behavior (as well as pandemic fatigue) is evident in the data.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Key takeaways from the a16z Marketplace 100</h4>
                            <h5><strong>1. Numbered list heading with an additional secondary line to show how it would look on the page.</strong></h5>
                            <p>
                                There were 25 new entrants to the Marketplace 100 this year, including the social shopping app <a href="#">Depop</a> (#46), local grocery delivery apps <a href="#">Mercato</a> (#34) and <a href="#">Dumpling</a> (#43), and the secondhand furniture marketplace <a href="#">AptDeco</a> (#78). While newcomers represent only 1 percent of the ranking’s total GMV, they provide a glimpse into emerging categories.
                            </p>
                            <p>Of the companies new to the Marketplace 100, nearly half fell into four categories: food and beverage, travel, music, and fashion. Collectively, these categories represented more than 70 percent of the freshmen GMV—<a href="#">Bandcamp</a>, the indie music marketplace, and <a href="#">Mercato</a>, an online grocery marketplace focused on local merchants, were the highest-ranking new entrants. Some of these shifts reflect the fallout from COVID: how we eat “out” and shop has changed dramatically over the past 12 months. </p>

                            <p>Similarly, a number of Marketplace 100 freshmen center around travel—but not as we once knew it. Rather than focusing on flights or traditional tours and hotels, rising travel marketplaces are leaning into outdoor travel. The Marketplace 100 freshmen include a marketplace to book unique campsites (<a href="#">Tentrr</a>), to travel in and park RVs (<a href="#">Harvest Hosts</a>), and to discover “luxury” camping experiences (<a href="#">Glamping Hub</a>). Those freshmen joined repeat Marketplace 100 companies like the camping marketplace <a href="#">Hipcamp</a> (which shot from #73 on last year’s list to #40) and RV rental companies <a href="#">Outdoorsy</a> (which climbed from #28 to #11) and <a href="#">RVshare</a> (from #35 to #14). </p>

                            <p>The year also ushered in a wave of new fashion marketplaces, including <a href="#">Curtsy</a>, <a href="#">Depop</a>, and <a href="#">Vestiaire Collective</a>. As opposed to focusing on top brands and luxury labels (like the RealReal or Poshmark), the freshmen fashion marketplaces specialize in unique, pre-owned items. The market for online thrifting continues to grow; it’s quickly becoming a stand-alone category to be reckoned with.</p>

                            <p>And though the pets category had just one new entrant—the dog adoption marketplace <a href="#">Good Dog</a> (#80), which joins repeat Marketplace 100 contenders <a href="#">Rover</a> (#5) and <a href="#">Wag</a> (#37)—the addition appears to be a harbinger of things to come. Pets have become an increasingly important part of people’s lives and budgets, a trend that accelerated over 2020. More than <a href="#">12 million</a> households took in pets in between March and December last year—dubbed “pandemic puppies”—and adoption rates multiplied.</p>

                            <p>Lastly, <a href="#">Whatnot</a>, a live shopping marketplace focused on collectibles, edged its way into the ranking at #99. Though the startup only launched in December 2019, the company has generated impressive growth (more on that below). In many ways, the collectibles space feels reminiscent of streetwear a few years ago, in the early days of <a href="#">GOAT</a> (#6) and <a href="#">StockX</a> (#4). (And now, via the rise of <a href="#">NFTs</a>, anyone can monetize their art or media.) These companies offer a unique shopping experience—streamed live (Whatnot) or authenticated (GOAT, StockX)—to a niche category with passionate users. That combination has fueled jaw-dropping growth. Collectibles is a category to watch this year.</p>
                            <h5><strong>2. Numbered list heading with an additional secondary line to show how it would look on the page.</strong></h5>
                            <p>Ten of the biggest marketplaces “graduated” from last year’s ranking when they went public or were acquired in 2020. Airbnb, Doordash, and Poshmark—three of the most prominent IPOs—represented over $150 billion combined in market cap at the end of their first day of trading. Postmates and Drizly are evidence that delivery-focused companies became hot acquisition targets this year. </p>
                            <p>Last year, we noted that the top marketplaces were big—really big. The graduates reinforce the idea that a handful of companies represent the bulk of the value. Through only 10 percent of the companies in last year’s Marketplace 100 went public or were acquired, those companies represented an astounding 57 percent of the ranking’s GMV last year. From a dollars perspective, that is a monumental amount of turnover.</p>

                            <p>One of the most striking results from this year’s ranking is <a href="#">Instacart’s</a> impressive edge. The online grocery delivery and pick-up provider accounts for more than 70 percent of GMV in the Marketplace 100. (For context, last year’s #1 marketplace, Airbnb, represented just over 30 percent of total GMV.) And despite Instacart’s enormous scale, it was the fifteenth fastest growing marketplace of 2020, as well.</p>
                            <p>There’s intense competition among the ranks of the Marketplace 100. Beyond the top three marketplaces on the list, no company accounts for more than 1.5 percent of consumer spend, and no company is separated from its immediate neighbors by more than half a percentage point. That means there could be a fair amount of shuffling in the coming months, and it’s likely we’ll see a markedly different Marketplace 100 next year.</p>

                            <p>Just as pandemic behavior catapulted a number of categories and companies into the ranking, the accompanying fears and necessary safety restrictions hindered others. In particular, childcare marketplaces shrunk 61 percent, ticketing marketplaces by 52 percent, and office space marketplaces by 30 percent. </p>
                            <h5><strong>4. Numbered list heading with an additional secondary line to show how it would look on the page.</strong></h5>
                            <p>There was considerable movement up the ranks by repeat Marketplace 100 companies. The biggest leaps came from the remote learning marketplace <a href="#">Outschool</a>, the celebrity engagement platform <a href="#">Cameo</a>, the campsite connector <a href="#">Hipcamp</a>, and the wholesale retail marketplace <a href="#">Faire</a>. These companies have something in common: they’re all fast-growing marketplaces in a “niche” category that was supercharged by pandemic behavior.</p>
                            <p>On average, these four standouts rose 41 spots in the Marketplace 100 ranking. Prior to 2020, the market size for these emerging companies was somewhat uncertain; the past year has revealed not only the enormity of the opportunity, but the strength of those companies’ product market fit. </p>
                            <p>When it comes to the success of business ideas—especially in tech—<strong>timing is critically important.</strong> The past year forced many marketplace companies to completely rethink their business models. Against all odds, a few lucky categories were in a position to grow.</p>

                             <li>In the winter we were still in the “old normal,” spending on things like childcare and tickets. In fact, over 70 percent of total 2020 spend in both of those categories was in Q1 alone.</li>
                             <li>In the spring, as shelter-in-place went into effect, people leaned on technology to stay entertained, connected, and relaxed: celebrity engagement (in the form of Cameo videos) grew approximately 250 percent from its Q1 mark, while flower delivery went up nearly 200 percent from Q1. While both those categories hit their high-water marks in Q2, cannabis delivery shot up well over 400 percent in Q2—and stayed there the rest of the year.</li>
                             <li>As summer rolled around, consumer consumers were either settling in or relocating entirely. Moving services like Dolly were up 200 percent and furniture marketplaces like AptDeco were up nearly 100 percent, compared to Q1. Meanwhile, people stuck at home revived the collectibles craze: that category shot up over 400 percent, relative to Q1.</li>
                             <li>And as the year came to a close, shopping started to make a comeback. Live shopping for collectibles maintained their momentum, and we saw increased spending on wholesale items (+350 percent, compared to Q1) and streetwear (+125 percent, compared to Q1), as well.</li>

                        <p>From food delivery to <strong>edtech</strong>, music, and camping, the companies on the ranking represent the activities that helped us make it through a tough year.

                        <p>Marketplaces companies will continue to play a key role as the economy recovers. We’re excited to see what the year ahead holds, and we’re intrigued to see how post-pandemic behavior might shake up next year’s Marketplace 100.</p>

                        <p>Of the companies new to the Marketplace 100, nearly half fell into four categories: food and beverage, travel, music, and fashion. Collectively, these categories represented more than 70 percent of the freshmen GMV—<a href="#">Bandcamp</a>, the indie music marketplace, and <a href="#">Mercato</a>, an online grocery marketplace focused on local merchants, were the highest-ranking new entrants. Some of these shifts reflect the fallout from COVID: how we eat “out” and shop has changed dramatically over the past 12 months.</p>

                        <p>Similarly, a number of Marketplace 100 freshmen center around travel—but not as we once knew it. Rather than focusing on flights or traditional tours and hotels, rising travel marketplaces are leaning into outdoor travel. The Marketplace 100 freshmen include a marketplace to book unique campsites (<a href="#">Tentrr</a>), to travel in and park RVs (<a href="#">Harvest Hosts</a>), and to discover “luxury” camping experiences (<a href="#">Glamping Hub</a>). Those freshmen joined repeat Marketplace 100 companies like the camping marketplace <a href="#">Hipcamp</a> (which shot from #73 on last year’s list to #40) and RV rental companies <a href="#">Outdoorsy</a> (which climbed from #28 to #11) and <a href="#">RVshare</a> (from #35 to #14).</p>

                        <p>The year also ushered in a wave of new fashion marketplaces, including <a href="#">Curtsy</a>, <a href="#">Depop</a>, and <a href="#">Vestiaire Collective</a>. As opposed to focusing on top brands and luxury labels (like the RealReal or Poshmark), the freshmen fashion marketplaces specialize in unique, pre-owned items. The market for online thrifting continues to grow; it’s quickly becoming a stand-alone category to be reckoned with.</p>

                        <p>And though the pets category had just one new entrant—the dog adoption marketplace <a href="#">Good Dog</a> (#80), which joins repeat Marketplace 100 contenders <a href="#">Rover</a> (#5) and <a href="#">Wag</a> (#37)—the addition appears to be a harbinger of things to come. Pets have become an increasingly important part of people’s lives and budgets, a trend that accelerated over 2020. More than <a href="#">12 million</a> households took in pets in between March and December last year—dubbed “pandemic puppies”—and adoption rates multiplied.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, <a href="#">Whatnot</a>, a live shopping marketplace focused on collectibles, edged its way into the ranking at #99. Though the startup only launched in December 2019, the company has generated impressive growth (more on that below). In many ways, the collectibles space feels reminiscent of streetwear a few years ago, in the early days of <a href="#">GOAT</a> (#6) and <a href="#">StockX</a> (#4). (And now, via the rise of <a href="#">NFTs</a>, anyone can monetize their art or media.) These companies offer a unique shopping experience—streamed live (Whatnot) or authenticated (GOAT, StockX)—to a niche category with passionate users. That combination has fueled jaw-dropping growth. Collectibles is a category to watch this year.</p>

                        <p>One of the most striking results from this year’s ranking is <a href="#">Instacart’s</a> impressive edge. The online grocery delivery and pick-up provider accounts for more than 70 percent of GMV in the Marketplace 100. (For context, last year’s #1 marketplace, Airbnb, represented just over 30 percent of total GMV.) And despite Instacart’s enormous scale, it was the fifteenth fastest growing marketplace of 2020, as well.</p>
                        <p>There’s intense competition among the ranks of the Marketplace 100. Beyond the top three marketplaces on the list, no company accounts for more than 1.5 percent of consumer spend, and no company is separated from its immediate neighbors by more than half a percentage point. That means there could be a fair amount of shuffling in the coming months, and it’s likely we’ll see a markedly different Marketplace 100 next year.</p>

                        <p>The past year had the potential to be a very tough year for marketplace companies, as it was for many industries. Instead, the Marketplace 100 is evidence of many startups’ impressive stamina, adaptability, and, more often than not, growth.</p>
                        <p>From food delivery to <strong>edtech</strong>, music, and camping, the companies on the ranking represent the activities that helped us make it through a tough year. The pandemic fundamentally altered how we travel, learn, and shop—and marketplace companies innovated to serve those needs.</p>
                        <p>Marketplaces companies will continue to play a key role as the economy recovers. We’re excited to see what the year ahead holds, and we’re intrigued to see how post-pandemic behavior might shake up next year’s Marketplace 100.</p>
                        <p>Congratulations to this year’s honorees. If your company is featured on the Marketplace 100 and you’d like to share the news, you can download a shareable badge here.</p>
